How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?
You don't win friends with salad. Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. Beer. Now there's a temporary solution. Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition.

I stand by my racial slur. Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son. " Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son.

That's why I love elementary school, Edna. The children believe anything you tell them.
Thank you, steal again. Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! Kids, we need to talk for a moment about Krusty Brand Chew Goo Gum Like Substance. We all knew it contained spider eggs, but the hantavirus? That came out of left field. So if you're experiencing numbness and/or comas, send five dollars to antidote, PO box…

They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day.
Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention!
"Thank the Lord"? That sounded like a prayer. A prayer in a public school. God has no place within these walls, just like facts don't have a place within an organized religion.
Please do not offer my god a peanut.
Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. I'm allergic to bee stings. They cause me to, uh, die. Marge, just about everything's a sin. Y'ever sat down and read this thing? Technically we're not supposed to go to the bathroom.

Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2.
Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face!
Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!"
I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows. How is education supposed to make me feel smarter? Besides, every time I learn something new, it pushes some old stuff out of my brain. Remember when I took that home winemaking course, and I forgot how to drive?

Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Oh, loneliness and cheeseburgers are a dangerous mix. This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."

Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. Facts are meaningless. You could use facts to prove anything that's even remotely true! This is the greatest case of false advertising I've seen since I sued the movie "The Never Ending Story."

Kids, you tried your best and you failed miserably. The lesson is, never try. I prefer a vehicle that doesn't hurt Mother Earth. It's a go-cart, powered by my own sense of self-satisfaction. Son, a woman is like a beer. They smell good, they look good, you'd step over your own mother just to get one! But you can't stop at one. You wanna drink another woman!

Donuts. Is there anything they can't do? Can't you people take the law into your own hands? I mean, we can't be policing the entire city! What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?

Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours.

Oh, so they have Internet on computers now! I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. What's the point of going out? We're just going to wind up back here anyway. I didn't think it was physically possible, but this both sucks *and* blows.

Oh, a *sarcasm* detector. Oh, that's a *really* useful invention! Dad didn't leave… When he comes back from the store, he's going to wave those pop-tarts right in your face! Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.

Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people. …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.

I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman. How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.

Stan Lee never left. I'm afraid his mind is no longer in mint condition. I'm going to the back seat of my car, with the woman I love, and I won't be back for ten minutes! Thank you, steal again. Duffman can't breathe! OH NO!
