Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.
Marge, you being a cop makes you the man! Which makes me the woman — and I have no interest in that, besides occasionally wearing the underwear, which as we discussed, is strictly a comfort thing. Son, when you participate in sporting events, it's not whether you win or lose: it's how drunk you get.

I hope this has taught you kids a lesson: kids never learn. Yes! I am a citizen! Now which way to the welfare office? I'm kidding, I'm kidding. I work, I work. Fire can be our friend; whether it's toasting marshmallows or raining down on Charlie.

I hope I didn't brain my damage.
Hi. I'm Troy McClure. You may remember me from such self-help tapes as "Smoke Yourself Thin" and "Get Some Confidence, Stupid!" Fame was like a drug. But what was even more like a drug were the drugs. Please do not offer my god a peanut.

How could you?! Haven't you learned anything from that guy who gives those sermons at church? Captain Whatshisname? We live in a society of laws! Why do you think I took you to all those Police Academy movies? For fun? Well, I didn't hear anybody laughing, did you? Except at that guy who made sound effects. Makes sound effects and laughs. Where was I? Oh yeah! Stay out of my booze.
Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2.
I'm normally not a praying man, but if you're up there, please save me, Superman.
Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2.
Attempted murder? Now honestly, what is that? Do they give a Nobel Prize for attempted chemistry? Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone. Lisa, vampires are make-believe, like elves, gremlins, and Eskimos.

What good is money if it can't inspire terror in your fellow man?
Oh, everything looks bad if you remember it.
I like my beer cold, my TV loud and my homosexuals flaming.
I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Fat Tony is a cancer on this fair city! He is the cancer and I am the…uh…what cures cancer? And now, in the spirit of the season: start shopping. And for every dollar of Krusty merchandise you buy, I will be nice to a sick kid. For legal purposes, sick kids may include hookers with a cold.

You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. Thank you, steal again. They only come out in the night. Or in this case, the day. But, Aquaman, you cannot marry a woman without gills. You're from two different worlds… Oh, I've wasted my life.

Slow down, Bart! My legs don't know how to be as long as yours. …And the fluffy kitten played with that ball of string all through the night. On a lighter note, a Kwik-E-Mart clerk was brutally murdered last night.

Dear Mr. President, There are too many states nowadays. Please, eliminate three. P.S. I am not a crackpot. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Remember the time he ate my goldfish? And you lied and said I never had goldfish. Then why did I have the bowl, Bart? *Why did I have the bowl?*

Aaah! Natural light! Get it off me! Get it off me! You don't like your job, you don't strike. You go in every day and do it really half-assed. That's the American way. Kids, kids. I'm not going to die. That only happens to bad people.

Your questions have become more redundant and annoying than the last three "Highlander" movies. Books are useless! I only ever read one book, "To Kill A Mockingbird," and it gave me absolutely no insight on how to kill mockingbirds! Sure it taught me not to judge a man by the color of his skin…but what good does *that* do me?

Bart, with $10,000 we'd be millionaires! We could buy all kinds of useful things like…love! I'll keep it short and sweet — Family. Religion. Friendship. These are the three demons you must slay if you wish to succeed in business.

Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel. Weaseling out of things is important to learn. It's what separates us from the animals…except the weasel.

Uh, no, you got the wrong number. This is 9-1…2. I can't go to juvie. They use guys like me as currency. Inflammable means flammable? What a country. Our differences are only skin deep, but our sames go down to the bone.

Thank you, steal again. Thank you, steal again. The Internet King? I wonder if he could provide faster nudity… Well, he's kind of had it in for me ever since I accidentally ran over his dog. Actually, replace "accidentally" with "repeatedly" and replace "dog" with "son."
